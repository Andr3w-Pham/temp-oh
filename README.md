# README for Temp-Oh. (Two Sided Marketplace)

### Project Management
* Before tackling any project it's best to plan everything out first. For this project I used [Trello](https://trello.com/) to to track my progress.

* I also made a spreadsheet to estimate required time for each task.

### Issue & Solution
 **Issue:**
- No platform that allows new & aspiring DJs to promote their music and receive bookings.

**Solution:**
- Build a two-sided marketplace that provides a platform for new & aspiring DJs to promote themselves and the chance to receive bookings from hosts(customers)

### User Stories
As a potential host(customer), I want to search for a DJ, so I can book a DJ for an event.

* I can browse through a list of DJs
* I can listen to their music
* I can review DJs
* Pressing 'Book' means that you agree to pay a DJ for their service.


As a DJ I want hosts(customers) to be able to browse my profile, so I can get bookings

* I can upload many songs and allow the public to browse & listen to my uploads
* I'm able to see all of the reviews about myself
* When someone presses 'Book', I will be able to check it in my bookings list
